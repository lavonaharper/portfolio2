    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p> When the pandemic hit in 2020, I was left with more time on my hands than I was ever use to.
        I used that opportunity to explore new fields and find what I was really passionate about.
        After taking a couple of web design courses, I knew I was interested in UX/UI, but I never took a leap and explored that interest.
        So with all the free time on my hands, I took it upon myself to persue a 100 Day Daily UI Challenge to build on my interest in UX/UI and learn how to use the design prototyping tool Sketch. 
        All of the designs were created with merely a simple description of what was to be designed and a 30 minute brainstorming session to then develop a creative design.
        Below are some examples of some of the designs I developed.
