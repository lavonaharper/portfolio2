    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>“Be creative!” “Think outside the box!”  “Communicate your ideas through something you are passionate about!” I sat frozen as my professor uttered those words.
    My mind went blank. I began to panic. How was I going to uniquely present my ideas and receive an exceptional grade without completely boring my classmates? I didn't have any special talents. Or so I thought.	
    It was this moment that allowed me to explore my unique ability to tell a story using visual arts. When I read or think, I can clearly visualize an image in my head, sometimes making it hard for me to communicate my thoughts only in words.
    Filmmaking has allowed to express my thoughts and share my point of view with others in a creative way. Not only do I display the story through a visual component, but the sound is timed with each clip! Below are a couple of my most significant pieces of work. I encourage you to take the time to watch them; they are quite entertaining!

    <h2> The Fall of the House of Usher:</h2>

        <p><em>The Fall of the House of Usher </em>is based off of the short story by Edgar Allen Poe about an unknown narrator visiting his childhood friend Rodrick Usher. 
       The story as well as this film, is meant to put you in the shoes of this mysterious narrator to evoke fear and rising tension as the plot progresses to then leave you in utter shock by the end of the story. 
       The features of the film will allow you to feel a sense of clasterphobia while also leaving you sitting at the edge of your seat. Watch to get the full experience! </p>
    <h2>Spring Break:</h2>

    <p><em>Spring Break</em> takes you on an adventure with three young college students going abroad on a spring break trip to Portugal. You will get to see laughs, smiles, and beautiful scenery!
    The film is fun, playful and shows a truly raw experience of the trip. Watch to go along for the ride!</p>
