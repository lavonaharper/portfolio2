    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>The transportation industry has evolved due to the increase of technology and innovation, so there are many options for transportation to get around town. 
        Cycling remains a popular choice of transportation as growing urban cities begin to crowd that is appealing commuting and exercise. Since cyclist are still on the streets, 
        it is important that we are continuing to find ways to reduce the risk that people run when they hop on their bikes to go to work every morning or take their families for a Sunday ride. 
        To reduce the risk that cyclists face, we must investigate the common factors that contribute to increasing pedicyclist fatalities. Some factors that increase fatalities include: increasing bike sales, season, time of day, day of the week, and population size. 
        This report analyzes and discusses the different factors that could contribute to pedicyclist crashes. Our hypothesis determines if there is a correlation between the the common factors listed above and cycling fatalities. <em>Factors Affecting Pedicyclist Crashes</em> applies data science methods using Python to clean, combine, and analyze several datasets to determine the culprits of cycling fatalities.</p>
    <h2>Key Objectives:</h2>
    <ol class="number_list">
        <li>Were there any significant differences regarding cycling between different calendar years?</li>
        <li>Age and gender have an influence on cycling fatalities? If so, which age group and gender? Why is that?</li>
        <li>A specific time of day or season has an effect on cycling fatalities?</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Findings:</h2>
    <ol class="number_list">
    <li>On average, there was not a significant difference regarding cycling between different calendar years and bike sales and fatalities did not have a strong correlation. Some of the recorded in this case were Olympic years, while others were not, and this caused local maxima on most of these years for annual bike sales. </li>
    <li>From significance testing, we concluded that males had significantly higher fatality rates. In addition, from the visuals, the fatality rates are significantly worse for men between the ages of 50-64. </li>
    <li>No hypothesis test concluded that there were statistically significant differences in fatalites when comparing weekend and weekdays, time of day, or seasons within those time frames. </li>
    </ol>
