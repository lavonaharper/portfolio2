    <p> Hello! </p> 
    <p>My name is Lavona Harper and I am a rising senior majoring in Information Science at Cornell University. I am concentrating in User Experience & Behavioral Science as well as minoring in Business.
        After watching an old couple struggle to order at the kiosk at Taco Bell, I have become passionate about product, especially creating products that are easy to use and accessible for all! I also love learning about the ways in which people interact with technology as our world becomes more technologically advanced. 
        I posses skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, Sketch, Figma, Scrum Methodology, and Usability Testing, but I am always opening to learning more!
    </p>

    <p> I am currently a Technology Analyst Intern at Deutsche Bank working on their UX team primarily creating wireframes for a new application and evaluating their current sites for usability issues.
    </p>

    <p> On top of the work that you see in this portfolio, I would like to add that this site was designed, coded and deployed by me!
